#!/bin/bash

#! is called as she-bang
shebang is completely optional
adding this will help us to udnerstand what type of script it is
For a file only one shebang is possible. If you keep one more shebang in second line then it is considered as comment.
Also shebang has to be in very first line.


shell scrit is nothing but adding all your manual commands in a order
